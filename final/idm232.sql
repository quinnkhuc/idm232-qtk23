Beat the mixture for 4 minutes on medium-high speed, stopping the mixer halfway through to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl (the butter and sugar will be very fluffy and pale yellow). </span></p>', '<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the mixer running, add the eggs and egg yolks one at a time. Allow each egg to fully incorporate before adding the next. After the last egg yolk is added, stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add the vanilla extract and mix for 30 seconds on medium-high speed, until just combined.</span></p>', '<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add ⅓ of the flour mixture (about 1 cup). Once mixed, add ⅓&nbsp; of the buttermilk. Repeat the process, alternating between the remaining flour and buttermilk. After you&rsquo;ve added the last buttermilk, mix the batter for about 30 seconds, until smooth. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Smooth the batter with a spatula. Gently tap the pan against the counter to remove any air bubbles.</span></p>', '<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bake for about 33 to 37 minutes, until golden brown. (A cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center of the cake should come out clean.) Place the pans on a wire rack and let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Turn the cakes out onto the wire rack. Remove and discard the parchment circles. Cool completely before icing with the frosting.</span></p>', '<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, confectioners&rsquo; sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Turn the mixer to low speed. Add the milk in a slow, steady stream. Add the vanilla and increase the speed to medium. Mix until smooth and fluffy, about 1 minute. Use immediately or store in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to 1 week. (Allow the frosting to come to room temperature and stir before using it on a cake.)</span></p>', '<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the cakes and frosting have cooled, layer and frost your cakes. Decorate as you see fit, and enjoy.</span></p>', '', '', '2021-12-06 17:42:09', '2021-12-06 17:42:09');
